      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
          Don't we all <em>love</em> lists... <br /> 
          They exist in all kinds of types; we devided them into three main sections: <a href="pages/personal.html">personal lists</a>, <a href="pages/practical.html">practical lists</a> and at last of course our <a href="pages/dream.html">dreamlists</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Personal lists</em> maybe are the most familar lists, we already made them since we were a child. They consider personal matter, such as your favorite artists, shows, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have a busy schedule <em>practical lists</em> will help you out. What to do before the concert, how to get there: it makes sense to organise these plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          And last but not least, there are our <em>dreamlists!</em> What artists do you still want to see live, what concerts / festivals would you like to visit in your lifetime!
